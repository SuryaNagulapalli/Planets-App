# Planets Slider App

This React application showcases a list of planets using **React Slick** for a smooth and interactive slider experience. The `PlanetsSlider` component dynamically displays planet details, allowing users to navigate through the list using **Next** and **Previous** buttons.

## Key Features
- **Planets List Display**: The `planetsList` is rendered as a slider using React Slick.
- **Planet Details**: Each planet object in the list contains:
  - `id` (String): Unique identifier for the planet.
  - `name` (String): Name of the planet.
  - `imageUrl` (String): URL of the planet's image.
  - `description` (String): Brief description of the planet.
- **Navigation**: Users can navigate through the planets using **Next** and **Previous** buttons to view the corresponding planet details.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **React Slick**: For creating a responsive and customizable slider.
- **CSS**: For styling the slider and planet details.

## How It Works
1. The `PlanetsSlider` component receives the `planetsList` as a prop.
2. The slider displays the current planet's image, name, and description.
3. Clicking the **Next** button shows the next planet in the list.
4. Clicking the **Previous** button shows the previous planet in the list.
